
Hello there! I'm Matt, the owner of this store. 
You must be looking to get geared up for the long trip West, am I right?
Well, if that's the case, you came to the right place!

Here's a list of everything you might need:

- Oxen ($40 per yoke)

A yoke of oxen is 2 oxen. The more oxen you have, the faster you will go!
If you run out of oxen out there on the trail, well,
let's just say survival chances dwindle for hikers.

<< You can spend between $100 and $200 on oxen >>

- Food ($0.50 per pound)

I recommend you purchase at the very least 200lbs. of food per person.
If you run out of food out there on the trail, you can always try
your hand at hunting, but you won't always be able to hunt enough
to feed everybody. That, and you have to spend more time hunting
instead of travelling! I wouldn't want to be out there when the 
winter hits!

- Bullets ($2 per box of 20)

Even if you don't plan on doing much hunting,
it doesn't hurt to purchase some ammunition as a backup plan.

- Wagon parts ($20 per part)

I'd highly recommend purchasing some wagon parts so that
in the unfortunate event that your wagon breaks down, you
have the means to repair it instead of being stuck out on
the trail.

- Medical aid kit ($25 per kit)

It's a long way to Oregon from here, and you're almost
guaranteed to run into some medical ailments here and there.
Purchasing some medical aid kits to treat those ailments will
greatly increase the chances of survival for you and your family.

There are other stores at forts along the trail, but the prices tend to get higher
and higher the further West you go. 

So. What can I get for you?
